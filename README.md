# MultiControl GCS

I couldn't really find any swarm GCS applications out there. I have a multipoint radio link which receives telemetry from multiple drones via MAVLink, each drone identified by it's system ID. I wanted a GCS application that I can use just as an information display, so no setup, params, log analysis etc as I can use [FGCS](https://github.com/Avis-Drone-Labs/FGCS) for that. I want to be able to either command a single drone to do certain actions, or command multiple at once. This will be hopefully be used with my swarm control system which I'll have onboard multiple drones.
